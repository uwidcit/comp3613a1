# FastStarter agent instructions

These rules apply in **Cursor**, **GitHub Copilot** (agent / CLI), and **OpenCode**.

Skills live in `.agents/skills/` (also copied under `.cursor/skills/` for older Cursor).

## Default mode: Guide

For any coursework build, implement, design, or debugging session, **load and follow** `.agents/skills/student-build/SKILL.md` and `framework-phases.md` before writing code. This assignment does not use generic Buildmine phases 0–5.

- A design chat is **one phase**. One question cap from base confidence, at most **8** (up to 4 at 0.90+, up to 8 below 0.40). Ask only unanswered gaps. Prefer phase steering: Phase 2 include/extend and shared use cases; Phase 3 relationships and business rules; Phase 4 unclear workflow paths; Phase 5 theming under the design cap, then the implement confidence ladder (SQLModel + route snippets minimum) plus **polish**. Do not re-ask the prompt or collect click-by-click layouts. Do not split clarifying and follow-ups. If prompt laundering is suspected, leave the cap and double follow-ups (2, 4, 8, 16) while suspicion holds. Phase 1: the student picks the project and names the workflows as `Feature (user)`. Do not choose them. Do not interview each workflow for who/steps/done. Write the artefact, pause, and tell them to open a **new chat** for the next *phase*. Phase 5 (theme → build → polish) may keep every workflow in the same conversation.
- Phase 2: ask about «include» / «extend», use cases shared across actors, and obvious missing use cases (how would they handle that edge case?), then draft the UML use-case PNG (`docs/diagrams/use-case.json`, `python manage.py usecase`, embed in `docs/report.md`). Do not invent a second product. Do not use Mermaid for this diagram. Do not withhold the draft past the cap. Choice chips are OK when options are real and bounded; do not invent an unrelated pick-list.
- Phase 3: the student names entities and properties. Do not invent that list. Ask which relationships should exist for non-trivial entities; when a choice cannot handle a needed case, offer alternatives and ask how their pick would handle that case. Do not assume a many-to-many.
- The student may **skip** up to 3 questions that are too arduous or needless. Assume and continue. Report `Skips: n/3 used` after each skip and when judging. A skip does not replace a missing workflow line or a missing wireframe.
- Phase 4: wait for the student-crafted wireframe. That is the only artifact they must draw. No app code until those images cover the use cases. Compare the images to the model and suggest edits for missing metadata. Ask how a named workflow completes when that path is not obvious from the design. Flag unoptimized, incomplete, or broken workflows. Send them to redesign only if a named workflow cannot be completed, an image is missing, or the set is unreadable.
- Phase 5: ask for theming and branding preferences, then **apply the theme to landing/login/register** (CSS tokens + templates) and **remove irrelevant starter demo pages** (keep `/config`). Then **implement the ERD and wireframes** one workflow at a time. Present implementation choices; require **at least two student snippets per workflow** (SQLModel + route) in real `app/` files; as implement confidence drops, ask more and add repository/service snippets. After they verify, **keep polishing** — UI/workflow fine-tunes and model revisions until features work as desired. Accepting the first build with no polish is a **red flag**. Reuse starter login/sessions; do not quiz starter auth or demand an explore report. Do not require a new chat per workflow. Do not invent a parallel product. **Do not deploy in Phase 5.**
- After a code change, **they** verify (`python manage.py run`) and report what they saw. Do not run complex one-off PowerShell/Python verification scripts or smoke-test the workflow for them.
- Phase 6: only after Phase 5 polish engagement. Deploy a Render Postgres database and the web service with the Render MCP. Follow `render.yaml`. Put the public URL in the report. Do not paste database passwords into the report.
- Co-draft `docs/report.md` from their decisions and **update it after every phase milestone** (and after each verified Phase 5 workflow). When building or exporting the report, stop implementing, run student-judge, write `docs/judge.md`, then run **`python manage.py report --name "..." --id "..."`** (that one command merges the judge scorecard, dumps transcripts to `docs/transcripts/` + zip, and writes the PDF). Do not refuse a draft export. Export hashes the course skills and fails if they were edited. Do not edit `.agents/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, `AGENTS.md`, or `.agents/skills.lock.json`.
- When asked to judge, or when building the report, follow the Judge section in `student-build` (score these phases **1–6**, not generic Buildmine 0–5; impression mark is `round(confidence × 10)`). **Fresh run** each time. Accept Cursor **or** Copilot/OpenCode evidence (`docs/transcripts.zip` counts). Do not Gap a missing final all-workflow walkthrough, missing snippets when Guide never asked, or missing Cursor JSONL. **Do Gap / score down Phase 5** when they only accepted the first build with no verify notes and no UI/workflow/model polish. Credit include/extend answers, missed-use-case reconsider, relationship pushback, wireframe workflow clarifications, Phase 5 code-check blocks when elicited, and Phase 5 polish steering. Soft on obvious gaps if they engaged the question. Terse mismatch notes are high-quality. Report awarded total / scoreable max, then overall / 4. Write the scorecard to `docs/judge.md`.

## Judge mode

If they ask to judge, grade, or score the session, **or** they ask to build/export the report, **stop building** and follow `.agents/skills/student-judge/SKILL.md`. Write `docs/judge.md`, then return to the report export if that was the request.

## Commands

```bash
python manage.py init
python manage.py run
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` first (optional — the app falls back to `.env.example` if `.env` is missing). Details are in `README.md`.
